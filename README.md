## 4. Setup<a name="step4"></a>

### 4.1 Assemble the Application
You need to have both Git and [West](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/index.html) installed, then execute below commands to gather the whole APP-SW-PACKS/CONVERSA-VOICE-CALLING delivery at branch ```${branch}``` and place it in a folder named ```appswpacks_conversa_voice_calling```. 

Replace ```${branch}``` with another branch within the repo to select the device you would like to use. This can be ```main_rt1170``` for the MIMXRT1170-EVK. To see other available devices, please check the other branches. 

```
west init -m https://github.com/nxp-appcodehub/ap-conversa-voice-calling --mr ${branch} appswpacks_conversa_voice_calling
cd appswpacks_conversa_voice_calling
west update
```

You can find more information about setup the application software pack in the Audio Lab Guides included in the [AN13752](https://www.nxp.com/doc/AN13752). 

### 4.2 Build and Run the Application
To build and run the application please refer to the chapter 5. Audio Lab Guides within the [AN13752](https://www.nxp.com/doc/AN13752).

### Application Overview
This software application pack enables a complete voice call application using NXPâ€™s i.MX RT1170 crossover MCU and Conversa Voice Suite.

After initializing the necessary hardware, the demo launches a Shell task:

1. **Shell Task:** Waits for user input to select one of the software configurations. Type ```help``` to see all the available options:

    With Conversa Voice Suite processing

        voicecall spswp16k    => Speaker phone with Conversa software (required voice call RT1170 mockup). Teams conferencing device 2.3m. Fs=16kHz
        voicecall spswp32k    => Speaker phone with Conversa software (required voice call RT1170 mockup). Teams conferencing device 2.3m. Fs=32kHz.

    Without Conversa Voice Suite processing

        voicecall usbswp16k    => USB microphones and USB speaker. Fs=16kHz
        voicecall usbswp32k    => USB microphones and USB speaker. Fs=32kHz

        WARNING : FOR lb CONFIGURATION REMOVE SPEAKER JACK CONNECTOR AND PLUG A HEADSET TO AVOID LARSERN EFFECT AND DAMAGE SPEAKER: WARNING
        WARNING : FOR lb CONFIGURATION REMOVE SPEAKER JACK CONNECTOR AND PLUG A HEADSET TO AVOID LARSERN EFFECT AND DAMAGE SPEAKER: WARNING

        voicecall lbswp16k    => Loop back between microphones and headset + USB microphones. Fs=16kHz
        voicecall lbswp32k    => Loop back between microphones and headset + USB microphones. Fs=16kHz


    **RT1170 mockup** : RT1170 EVKA (3 microphones used) + TA2024 amplifier + 1 TangBand 2136 speaker

    **sp** : sp means speaker phone with Conversa software. Conversa Tx output is sent to Tx USB channel 0. Conversa Rx output is sent to the speaker.

    **usb** : USB only use case, no process is running. Tx chain input (microphones) datas are sent USB Tx. USB Rx datas are sent to speakers. No process is present.
    
    **lb**  : lb means loop back. Tx chain input are sent to speakers and to USB Tx. USB Rx datas are not handled. No process is present.
    
    WARNING : FOR lb CONFIGURATION REMOVE SPEAKER JACK CONNECTOR AND PLUG A HEADSET TO AVOID HOWLING AND POTENTIAL SPEAKER DAMAGE: WARNING

    Once you select an option, the demo launches an AUDIO_TxRxTask.


2. **AUDIO_TxRxTask:** The AUDIO Task configures the audio paths and handles the input and output audio buffers to enable the voice calling application.

If a conversa voice calling software configuration is selected, the AUDIO task will execute the Conversa echo-cancelling audio processing.

**NOTE:** The Conversa library comes with a 10-minute trial timeout.
